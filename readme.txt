# Leaky Bucket Algorithm Simulation using OpenGL

## Project Overview

This project is a graphical simulation of the **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**, developed using **OpenGL**, with the goal of visually representing how the algorithm manages network traffic flow. It provides an engaging and interactive way to understand how data flow control prevents network congestion and data loss.
